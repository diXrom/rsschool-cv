## About Me:

I am 26 years old, I worked as an energy engineer. Only now I realized that I want to become a web developer. So I quit my job and started studying everything related to front-end development. My strengths are persistence and quick learning. I have good communication skills, so I work great in a team. My goal is to become a web developer in a year. This is why I am here.
